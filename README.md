### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I used existing data sets to randomly generate motivational posters at the click of a button. Users have the option to save these posters and view them in a list on a seperate page. <br>
Additionally, there is a function where users can create their own posters by linking an image and typing in the desired title and quote. <br>
Finally, an Un-Motivational Posters page was added. This generates a list of unmotivational posters, and users have the option to delete a poster by double clicking.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
* Cloning the application down from GitHub.
* Open it with the `open index.html` command.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was given to me on the first day of the second inning. I was given nine days to complete this project; however, I have never worked with JavaScript before. This project forced me to learn at a rapid pace, as is all projects at Turing.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to your GitHub. Consider also providing LinkedIn link)
Part of the application was prebuilt by Turing and the rest I comppleted on my own.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    * Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
    * Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
    * Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
* Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
1. Learning how to style with CSS
2. Learning to iterate through arrays
3. Learning how JavaScript works with HTML elements<br>

Challenges:
1. Deleting an HTML element and preventing it from reappearing when navigating pages.
